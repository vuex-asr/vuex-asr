# Vuex-ASR - Automated Store Resolution for Vue | Documentation

#### Quick summary

Vuex-asr removes the necessity to describe your vuex store bindings in the component's script (state, getters, mutations, actions). The plugin automatically resolves  bindings and is able to map them from the component's attributes, allowing your component's code to become **generic** and **independent** from the Vuex store :sunglasses:.
