# prerequisite

As a pre-requisite I assume you have a basic understanding of **Javascript** and **Vue** and a curiousity on how to make large(r) scale applications more concise.

And although concepts like store- and statemanagement, with **VUEX** (a Vue plugin for store/state management) are discussed in depth, I'm convinced there is **no prior experience needed** to start using this plugin, since most of the Vuex implementation will be automatically handled by this plugin.
