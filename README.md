# Vuex-ASR, Automated Store Resolution for Vue

Vuex ASR leverages the ability to bind store items to a component by attribute. It also enables you to map the store items to the nameconvention you use in your components, This means that your components code becomes independent from the store.

### Contribution guidelines ###

#### Writing tests
create a test file in

for conventions.

On a more general level, try to be concise in formulating the objective of your test.

And please also share work in progress if you get stuck, include a link to a codesandbox or scrimble.
